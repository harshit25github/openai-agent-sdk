        "output_text": "Both Tokyo and Kyoto are incredible destinations, but they offer different experiences:\n\n**Tokyo**  \n- **Modern & Historic:** A vibrant metropolis with cutting-edge technology, towering skyscrapers, and unique neighborhoods (Shibuya, Shinjuku, Akihabara).  \n- **World-Class Food & Shopping:** Endless choices from sushi to international cuisine, plus famous shopping districts like Ginza and Harajuku.  \n- **Cultural Sites:** Historic temples (Meiji Shrine, Senso-ji), but fewer than Kyoto.  \n- **Day Trips:** Easy access to places like Yokohama, Nikko, or Mt. Fuji.\n\n**Kyoto**  \n- **Rich Tradition:** The heart of classic Japanese culture, famous for its beautiful temples, shrines, and gardens (Fushimi Inari, Kinkaku-ji).  \n- **Historic Streets:** Charming districts with preserved old wooden houses (Gion, Higashiyama), plus the chance to spot geisha.  \n- **Pace:** Quieter and more relaxed than Tokyo; ideal for traditional tea ceremonies, walks, and cultural immersion.  \n- **Seasonal Beauty:** Famous for cherry blossoms in spring and colorful leaves in autumn.\n\n**Decision Guide:**  \n- If you want an energetic city with lots to do and see, choose **Tokyo**.\n- If you prefer culture, tradition, and a slower pace, pick **Kyoto**.\n- Both cities have excellent food, stunning sights, and unique experiences. For 5 days, either is enough to get a real taste.\n\nLet me know your preferences—do you lean toward modern energy or traditional charm? If you want a tailored recommendation, I can help!"
